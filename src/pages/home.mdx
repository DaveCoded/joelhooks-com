Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joel Hooks. I'm a skilled virtual assistant, software developer, and the co-founder of the website [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/s/dtccr).

This I my personal site where I drop notes and articles about things that I am interested in. Generally speaking this journal will capture thoughts I have about building bootstrapped business, raising kids, learning, teaching, and my endless obsession with media and gear.

The entries on this page aren't all complete thoughts. It's a space for me to post what I like and I try not to hoard drafts like some sort of digital Smog. Instead I choose to just let things fly and circle back to them later if I feel like it.

If you'd like to get in touch with me [email](mailto:joelhooks@gmail.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks) are your best channels.

I get a **lot** of requests from folks that want to be egghead instructors. I appreciate this enthusiasm! Check out [How to egghead](https://howtoegghead.com) and understand that _you don't need my permission_ to start creating screencasts. Just do it. Post them someplace and share them with me and the world. ðŸ˜€

If you like something you read here, please feel free to share it and let me know. It's always nice to get feedback.
