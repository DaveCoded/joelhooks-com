What is a badass? I love the word itself, because there is practically no way to use it in a negative way. It's a **good** word.

In Kathy Sierra's book, the word **badass** is used to describe an expert. Somebody that has learned a skill, crossed the "valley of suck" and achieved mastery.

This book has been very influential to John and I as we've built egghead over the last several years. In fact, we send a copy to every instructor when they receive their pro audio kit. We've never formally followed up to see if they actually read the book, but I hope they do.

This book is relatively short, and it is full of pictures and diagrams in Kathy's "head first" style that she pioneered in her O'Reilly book series. It's a serious book though, and arguably one of the most approachable books on instructional design and user experience that I have ever encountered.

This page contains my notes. It's very strictly written and maintained so that I can reference and add context to the book based on my context and understanding. While I read this book when it was published in 2015, at the time I was very immersed in building egghead so was able to "get the gist" and apply the ideas and philosophy in a loose sense.

Over that time, most of the focus that were we have applied Badass has been in the practice of onboarding content creators as instructors, and tuning that process. The skills that go into producing Badass educational content are daunting, non-trivial, and require study and practice.

If you want to be a badass screencaster, it takes **a lot** of hard work.

After several years of running egghead, I'm revisiting Badass, but this time I want to go deeper. Even at a surface level its helped us by providing an anchor that we can point to and say "ya, that's what we are doing. We're making badass instructors and badass web developers that they are teaching" as a core and driving philosophy.

But this time I rereading with a highlighter in hand and a mind eager to understand and apply the lessons Kathy is providing in a deeper way. I want to follow the thread, and correlate Badass directly to the contexts that we work on every day at egghead.
