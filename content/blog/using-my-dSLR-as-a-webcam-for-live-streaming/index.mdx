Broadcasting on the internet is here to stay. More and more we are seeing people use sites like Twitch and Youtube to deliver real-time video and audio to connect with their audience.

Increasingly over the years as a remote worker video chats have become more and more the standard of communication. Tools like [Zoom](http://bit.ly/2Rim3QZ) have turned what used to be a choppy, shitty, robo-voice experience into a smooth high-quality communication channel.

At egghead we are using [Zoom webinars](http://bit.ly/2Rim3QZ) to put on live streaming video events for our members.

It's a lot of fun, and it means that high quality audio and video is more important than ever.

For years I've been true and loyal to Logitech HD web cams. They aren't bad, cost about \$100, and generally give you enough quality to get by for video calls. For the mac I use iGlasses, software that gives you color controls over the webcam. Overall, this will get you to "good enough".

This is actually the camera on my mac, not the logitech. It might not even get a "good enough" rating ;)

As I spend more time on video, I want the quality to match the effort.

## Very high quality streaming internet video

I'm an AV nerd. Gear makes me giddy. I've got a small collection of SLR cameras and lenses that produce beautiful recorded photos and videos.

To use an SLR as a webcam it needs "clean" HDMI output. Clean means that the HDMI signal doesn't have text overlays displaying various settings. Makes sense, that'd look really bad.

You also need a camera that will stay awake if it is left on. Some cameras insist on sleeping and won't let you override it, and that wouldn't be good if you are streaming video.

I'm using the [Sony Alpha a9](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06ZY7GNKN/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/). It's an amazing full-frame camera that I use and love for all of my photo and video needs. Sony has been putting out amazing lenses and accessories for the Alpha series for years. It is relatively small and light compared to other full-frame SLRs.

It's arguably overbuilt for as a webcam. It's definitely not the budget option. ðŸ˜¬

[The Panasonic Lumix G85](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M050N05/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/) is a great camera that will serve this purpose very well, and not break the bank.

If you already own an HD capable SLR or video camera [here's a tool](https://www.atomos.com/cameras) to check if it has compatible clean HDMI output.

## The Webcam Adapter

Now that you've got a nice camera with clean HDMI out, you need to have it recognized as a webcam. Simply plugging it in to the USB port won't work, it needs to have a device in between to "trick" the computer into seeing the HDMI signal as a webcam.

At the low-end, the [elgato Cam Link 4k](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07K3FN5MR/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/) is effective and simple. It has an HDMI port on one side and a USB port on the other. When you plug the camera into the hdmi port and the usb into the computer, your SLR will show up as a webcam. ez

For a more substantial solution the [Blackmagic Web Presenter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N5YEI0O/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/) is a great upgrade. It gives you multiple input options and even lets you switch between inputs. It is also a USB interface for audio equipment, so you can hook your mic into it as well. Similar to the elgato, you just need to plug in the HDMI in and connect the USB to the computer and it "just works". Note that you need to buy both a power cable and a usb cable for this thing. They don't come included and that can be annoying.

## Lights!

To get a good picture you absolutely need to supplement your lighting. These days there is a great selection of LED lights that work as a softbox.

There's a LOT of garbage in this space, so watch out for the cheap stuff. I went for the [FotodioX FlapJack](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B013TSPWXO/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/), and it is really great. It lets you control the temperature and the brightness is just right for a desktop situation.

You'll probably want a light stand for the light as well, and [this little one](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001D2GQ8Y/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/) fit well on my desk.

The camera is strongly gripping the monitor with the [GorillaPod 5k tripod](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B074WG19MP/joehoobuiblo-20/ref=nosim/). They are awesome flexible tripods that always amaze me with their versatility.

High quality audio and video are essential if you are broadcasting professionally. For years I avoided video conferencing, but now that bandwidth and equipment has caught up I find myself in more and more face to face conversations over the internet. I'm excited for the potential to connect and communicate without geographic proximity being a limiting factor.
